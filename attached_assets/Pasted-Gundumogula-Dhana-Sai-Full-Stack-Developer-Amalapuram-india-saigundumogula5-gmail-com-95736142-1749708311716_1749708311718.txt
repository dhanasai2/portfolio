Gundumogula Dhana Sai , Full Stack Developer, Amalapuram, india, saigundumogula5@gmail.com, 9573614202, non, I'm Gundumogula Dhana Sai, a passionate and results-driven B.Tech Information Technology student at JNTU Gurajada Vizianagaram. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in building scalable web applications, full-stack solutions, and AI-powered systems. I enjoy solving real-world problems using technology—whether it's building job portals with Django or working on gesture and eye-movement-controlled applications using Python and OpenCV.Over the past couple of years, I've honed my skills in modern frameworks, databases, and DevOps tools, while earning certifications in MongoDB, Cybersecurity, and DevOps. I’ve also participated in hackathons, completed internships, and developed several end-to-end projects. Currently, I'm exploring the intersection of AI, security, and scalable web systems. I'm on a mission to become a software engineer who builds impactful solutions while continuously learning and evolving.
